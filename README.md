# ðŸ¤– Chatbot (Side Project)

This is a personal learning project to build a simple rule-based chatbot using **Python**, **Keras**, and **Flask**. It leverages natural language processing (NLP) techniques like tokenization and lemmatization, and is trained on a custom dataset of intents.

## ðŸ§  Features
- Intent classification using a neural network (trained with Keras)
- Bag-of-words model for feature extraction
- JSON-based intent structure with responses
- Simple web interface built with HTML + jQuery
- Flask API backend for handling user messages

---


ðŸ’¡ Notes
	â€¢	All NLP preprocessing is done with NLTK (word tokenization + lemmatization).
	â€¢	The chat interface is minimal, just enough to test the bot in a browser.
	â€¢	The chatbot is rule-based and limited to the training data (no dynamic learning).

ðŸ“š Learning Goals
	â€¢	Understand intent classification pipeline
	â€¢	Practice model training using Keras
	â€¢	Build a basic full-stack app with Python and HTML
	â€¢	Learn how to serve ML models using Flask APIs
